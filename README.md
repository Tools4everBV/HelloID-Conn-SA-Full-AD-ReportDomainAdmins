## Manual resources
This Delegated Form uses the following resources in order to run

### Powershell data source 'AD-user-generate-table-report-domain-admins'
This Powershell data source runs an Active Directory query to select the AD user accounts that are member of the group "Domain Admins"

### Delegated form task 'AD - Report - Accounts member of Domain Admins'
This delegated form task runs the same Active Directory query as the task data source (AD query is defined at two places) and export the data to a local CSV file if selected in the form.
